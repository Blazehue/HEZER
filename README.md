# 🚀 Space Shooter - Endless Flying Shooter Game

An immersive browser-based endless flying shooter built with LittleJS, featuring third-person 2.5D perspective, pseudo-3D projection, and intense space combat action!

> 🎮 **Born from experimentation!** This game was created while exploring the LittleJS engine for the first time — a journey from curiosity to a fully-playable space shooter with nitro boosts, pseudo-3D combat, and retro-futuristic vibes!

- **Smart Collision**: Distance-based 3D collision detection

### 💻 Technical Implementation
- **Pseudo-3D Projection System**: 
  ```javascript
  function project3D(x, y, z) {
      const scale = CAMERA_FOV / (CAMERA_FOV + z);
      return { x: x * scale, y: y * scale, scale };
  }
  ```
- **Depth Sorting**: Objects rendered in correct depth order
- **Particle Systems**: Engine trails, smoke, and explosions
- **Camera FOV**: 500 units for realistic perspective
